# Runetrinket Counter
This is a simple mod to add a way to view the current Runetrinkets situation without opening the Perks screen.

## Script installation
### Modloader
Intended use is merely to have installed GodNooNoo's [ModLoader](https://github.com/GodNooNoo/TrimpsModLoader).  
However, manual installation should be possible through one of the following paths:

### Browser
Create a new Tampermonkey script with the contents of this repository's `RunetrinketCounter.user.js` file.

### Steam
Download this repository's `mods.js` file, and place it in the /mods/ folder inside the Trimps folder.

More in-depth instructions can be found at the ModLoader's page, if you need them.
